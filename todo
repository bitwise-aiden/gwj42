            Take part in the battle of the gods to help determine the one true God of Gaming

            To be declared the victor, you must defeat a number of gods from across the mythos (Not sure what word to put here).

            -- Page 2

            Each competitor will have a deck comprising of the following runes*

            *Some may be tricky, so keep an eye out. 

            -- Page 3

            You will take turns placing runes onto the plinth. Once all are filled, they will be flipped and the battle begins. 

            <picture of what beats what> 

            Runes will battle based on the plinth directly in front of them. 

            Scoring is a sum of both battles:
                2 wins = 2 damage to the loser
                1 win + 1 draw = 1 damage to the lower 
                1 win + 1 loss = neutral, no one takes damage
                2 draws = neutral, no one takes damage

            Good luck on your conquest! May you be declared the God of Gaming!
