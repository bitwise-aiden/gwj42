            Take part in the ultimate battle of the gods to help determine the one true God of Gaming

            To be declared the victor, you must defeat a number of ancient gods from across the mythosphere.

            -- Page 2

            Each competitor will have a deck of 9 stones comprising of the following runes*

            <picture of runes in deck> 

            *Not all competitors have even numbered amounts of these runes and may be tricky, so keep an eye out!

            -- Page 3
            Gameplay:
            During a battle, you must move your runes onto your two plinths. Once all are filled, they will be flipped and the battle begins. 

            <picture of what beats what> 

            Runes will battle based on the plinth directly in front of them.
            Get your opponent's HP down to 0 to win!

            Scoring is a sum of both battles:
                2 wins = 2 damage to the loser
                1 win + 1 draw = 1 damage to the loser
                1 win + 1 loss = neutral, no one takes damage
                2 draws = neutral, no one takes damage

            Good luck on your conquest! May you be declared the God of Gaming!
